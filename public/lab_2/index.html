            <p>
                Dear Dover,<br>
                <br>
                Thank you for your recent application to join us at UMD's iSchool to study for your undergraduate in 2020. I will answer your questions one by one, in <br>
                the following sections.<br>
            </p>
            <h2><strong>Starting dates</strong></h2>
            <p>
                We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a <br>
                semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br>
                <ul TYPE="disc">
                    <li>First semester: 29 August 2020
                    <li>Second semester: 22 January 2021
                    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2021
                </ul>
                Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>
                You can find more information about <a href="https://academiccatalog.umd.edu/about-university/academic-calendar/semester-calendar/">important university dates</a> on our website.<br>               
            </p>
            <h2><strong>Subjects of study</strong></h2>
            <p>
                At the iSchool, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of information studies. You seem <br>
                like a committed researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
                by are as follows, in order of priority: <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
                    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)
                    <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and 
                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.
                </ol>       
                So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other <br>
                resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks. <br>
            </p>
            <h2><strong>Animals of the Extended Perambulation</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study animals. To answer your question, my favourite creatures are as follows, with <br>
                definitions:<br>
                <dl>
                    <dt>The Canadian Polar bear</dt>
                    <dd>A large predator, <em>very</em> hungry these days. Feeds almost entirely on seal.</dd>
                    <dt>The elk</dt>
                    <dd>An elk is a horned ungulate found primarily in the mountainous regions of British Columbia. It can be seen from railways, and also frequently <br>
                        visits the Banff centre for the arts.</dd>
                    <dt>The red-tailed hawk</dt>
                    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation: many people believe eagles make the screaming noise associated with them on film. This cry is <br>
                        instead the call of the red-tail.</dd>
                </dl>

                Yours sincerely,<br>
